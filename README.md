# AWS EC2 Instance
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. In this repository, I explore various aspects of EC2 instances, from getting started with launching instances to configuring environments and exploring advanced features.

## To get started with EC2 instances, 

1.sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2.Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3.Launch your first EC2 instance using the Launch Instance Wizard.
4.Connect to your instance using SSH or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
5.Explore the instance and start using it for your computing needs.

For detailed instructions, refer to the official AWS documentation.

## Configuration
In this section, you'll find resources related to configuring and managing EC2 instances:

Security Groups: Learn how to control traffic to your instances using security groups.
Key Pairs: Manage key pairs for secure access to your instances.
Instance Types: Explore different instance types and choose the one that best fits your workload.
For more information, refer to the AWS EC2 Documentation.
